AI Enabeld Phishing Detection

Tech Stack: Python, scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Flask


This project focuses on detecting phishing websites using AI-based techniques. It involves building a machine learning model to classify URLs as phishing or legitimate. The dataset is preprocessed to extract features such as URL length, presence of special characters, and SSL certificate status. The model is trained using supervised learning algorithms to ensure accurate predictions.

Key Features: Extracted and analyzed features from URLs to identify patterns associated with phishing. Built and trained a machine learning model for phishing detection. Deployed the model as a web application using Flask for real-time URL classification.

This project shows how AI can be leveraged to enhance cybersecurity and protect users from malicious attacks.
